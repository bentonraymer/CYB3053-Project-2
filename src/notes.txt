NOTES TO SELF AND DEFINITIONS - My brain dump as I try and think through this
- We are only dealing with the Heap here
- The Heap expands downwards when viewed as a chart, upwards in terms of addresses
- We use the sbrk() function to actually allocate more memory to our program
- There is a pre-set "Alignment" variable of 16... this is used to make sure blocks of memory are assigned starting at a multiple of 16 bytes for easier handling by the CPU
